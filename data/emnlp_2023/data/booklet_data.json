To this end, the tutorial will introduce NLP+Vis with a focus on two main threads of work: \\textit{(i) NLP for Vis:} How to develop and adapt state-of-the-art NLP models for solving various visualization tasks? and \\textit{(ii) Vis for NLP:} How to leverage visualization techniques to interpret and explain complex NLP models effectively? The tutorial will first motivate why NLP+Vis is an important area of research and provide an overview of research topics on combining NLP and Vis techniques. Then an overview of state-of-the-art deep learning models for NLP will be covered. Next, we will provide an overview of applying visualization techniques to help make NLP models more interpretable and explainable. In the final part, we will focus on various application tasks at the intersection of NLP and Vis. We will conclude with an interactive discussion of future challenges for NLP+Vis applications. The audience will include researchers interested in applying NLP for visualizations as well as others who focus more generally at the intersection of machine learning and visualization.",

            "desc": "The progress of natural language processing (NLP) is primarily driven by machine learning that optimizes a system on a large-scale set of task-specific labeled examples. This learning paradigm limits the ability of machines to have the same capabilities as humans in handling new tasks since humans can often solve unseen tasks with a couple of examples accompanied by task instructions. In addition, we may not have a chance to prepare task-specific examples of large-volume for new tasks because we cannot foresee what task needs to be addressed next and how complex to annotate for it. Therefore, task instructions act as a novel and promising resource for supervision. This tutorial targets researchers and practitioners who are interested in AI and ML technologies for NLP generalization in a low-shot scenario. In particular, we will present a diverse thread of instruction-driven NLP studies that try to answer the following questions: (i) What is task instruction? (ii) How is the process of creating datasets and evaluating systems conducted? (iii) How to encode task instructions? (iv) When and why do some instructions work better? (v) What concerns remain in LLM-driven instruction following? We will discuss several lines of frontier research that tackle those challenges and will conclude the tutorial by outlining directions for further investigation.",

While several surveys, tutorials, and workshops have discussed the risks of harms in specific contexts -- e.g., detecting and mitigating gender bias in NLP models -- no prior work has developed a unified typology of technical approaches for mitigating harms of language generation models. Our tutorial is based on a survey we recently wrote that proposes such a typology. We will provide an overview of potential social issues in language generation, including toxicity, social biases, misinformation, factual inconsistency, and privacy violations. Our primary focus will be on how to systematically identify risks, and how eliminate them at various stages of model development, from data collection, to model development, to inference/language generation. Through this tutorial, we aim to equip NLP researchers and engineers with a suite of practical tools for mitigating safety risks from pretrained language generation models.",

The 2023 iteration of the workshop will build on the successes of prior iterations (2017-2022) with a focus on diversity in scientific background, discipline, training, obtained degrees, and seniority. Additionally, this iteration will target women and nonbinary researchers, the queer community, researchers outside the U.S. and Europe, and neurodiverse researchers in NLP. The full-day event will include a call for abstracts, a combination of invited talks, a panel discussion, oral presentations, and poster sessions. The workshop provides an opportunity for junior members of the community to showcase their work and connect with senior mentors for feedback and career advice. WiNLP also offers recruitment opportunities with leading industrial and academic labs. Most importantly, the workshop provides an accepting space that lowers structural barriers that make it difficult for URGs to join and collaborate with their NLP colleagues. The opportunity to present at the workshop is intended for URGs, and allies are encouraged to attend and support speakers.

Over the years, this workshop series has successfully organized five shared tasks, which stimulated interest in new problems in this area of research, facilitated the discussion and dissemination of results on new problems/directions (e.g., multimodal reference resolution), and helped expand the coreference community that used to be dominated by European researchers to include young researchers from the Americas. The aim of the workshop is to provide a forum where work on all aspects of computational work on anaphora resolution and annotation, including both coreference and types of anaphora such as bridging references resolution and discourse deixis, can be presented.",

CS can occur on various\nlanguage levels including inter-sentential, intra-sentential, and even morphological. Practically, it presents long-standing challenges for language technologies, such as machine translation, ASR, language generation, information retrieval and extraction, and semantic processing. Models trained for one language can quickly break down when there is input mixed in from another. The recent breakthough on using multilingual pre-trained language models (LMs) have shown possibility to yield subpar performance on CS data.\nConsidering the ubiquitous nature of CS in informal text such as newsgroups, tweets threads, and other forms of social media communication, and the number of multilingual speakers worldwide that use these platforms, addressing the challenge of processing CS data continues to be of great practical value. This workshop aims to bring together researchers interested in technology for mixed language data, in either spoken or written form, and increase community awareness of the different efforts developed to date in this space.",

NLP technologies allow legal practitioners and decision-makers to make more informed decisions, optimize legal strategies and serve clients/consumers/citizens in a more cost-efficient way. The fast-paced, multi-jurisdictional world of law is a growing area of application for NLP, offering data sources which are often multilingual and multimodal. For example, evidentiary data sets used in private and public legal practice require in-depth image analysis and speech recognition technologies to complement text data (e.g., opinions and judgments) currently dominating the area. Legal NLP research can create societal impact by informing regulators how to best protect certain categories of citizens at risk (e.g. vulnerable consumers), or by enhancing citizen education and access to justice. This is an exciting opportunity to expand the boundaries of our field by identifying new problems and exploring new data as it interacts with the full inventory of NLP and machine learning approaches.",

This morphologically rich language has a long-standing literacy tradition, with diverse dialects and language dependent challenges. Bangla, with three decade of research history is still considered a low-resource language in the natural language processing (NLP) and speech community mainly due to the limited and scattered research efforts by individual researchers. These line of sparse works are not highly visible to the international research community.\n\nTherefore, this workshop aims to provide a forum for researchers to share and discuss their ongoing work with the international community. Following the success of prior local editions of the conferences in 2018 and 2019, in this first edition of the workshop, we will focus on Bangla, which is a low-resource language, and assess its current state-of-the-art and discuss strategies to make further progress in both NLP, Speech and multimodal research. Through this workshop, we plan to bring researchers together to come up with frameworks and strategies that can later support to other low-resource languages. This workshop is timely given the continued rise in research projects focusing on low-resource and multilingual studies. We particularly encourage researchers to submit their papers focusing on novel methodologies and resources that help towards the progress of Bangla and other low-resource languages. Novel methodologies include, but are not limited to, zero-shot learning, unsupervised learning, and simple yet effective methods applicable to low-computation scenarios.",
